Metal Furnace Challenge : Weekend Hackathon
image

Manufacturing of any alloy is not a simple process. Many complicated factors are involved in the making of a perfect alloy, from the temperature at which various metals are melted to the presence of impurities to the cooling temperature set to cool down the alloy. Very minor changes in any of these factors can affect the quality or grade of the alloy produced.

Given are 28 distinguishing factors in the manufacturing of an alloy, your objective as a data scientist is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict the grade of the product using these factors.

You are provided with 28 anonymized factors (f0 to f27) that influence the making of a perfect alloy that is to be used for various applications based on the grade/quality of the obtained product.

Insurance Churn Prediction : Weekend Hackathon #2

Insurance companies around the world operate in a very competitive environment. With various aspects of data collected from millions of customers, it is painstakingly hard to analyze and understand the reason for a customer’s decision to switch to a different insurance provider.

For an industry where customer acquisition and retention are equally important, and the former being a more expensive process, insurance companies rely on data to understand customer behaviour to prevent retention. Thus knowing whether a customer is possibly going to switch beforehand gives Insurance companies an opportunity to come up with strategies to prevent it from actually happening.

Given are 16 distinguishing factors that can help in understanding the customer churn, your objective as a data scientist is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether the insurance company will lose a customer or not using these factors.

You are provided with 16 anonymized factors (feature_0 to feature 15) that influence the churn of customers in the insurance industry

Data Description
The unzipped folder will have the following files.

Train.csv – 33908 observations.
